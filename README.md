# Calculib2
This lib allows to create (and port easily) code that can run on your computer and a calc just by using the corresponding makefile.

It's designed for Casio's Graph calculators, fxlib is reimplemented for linux.
You need the NESSCASDK to use it, casio's headers and a cross-compiler are requiered too.

A lot is left to do (Print, Timers, test ML, Fixing calc target, [...]) but it's enough to run Spassus2.
3Pin serial emulation is supported by using network sockets and a server, USB will come too.
